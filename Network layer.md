Network Layer (Layer 3) of the OSI Model
The Network Layer is the third layer of the OSI model and is responsible for routing, addressing, and forwarding data between devices across different networks. 
It determines the best path for data to travel from the source to the destination, ensuring that packets reach the correct recipient.

Key Functions of the Network Layer
Logical Addressing (IP Addressing)

Assigns a unique address (IP address) to each device on the network.
Example: IPv4 (192.168.1.1) and IPv6 (2001:db8::1).
Routing

Determines the best path for data packets to travel between networks.
Uses routing algorithms and protocols (e.g., OSPF, BGP, RIP).
Packet Forwarding

Moves packets from one network to another based on IP addresses.
Example: A router forwards packets from a home network to the internet.
Fragmentation and Reassembly

Splits large packets into smaller fragments for transmission.
Reassembles them at the destination device.
Error Handling and Congestion Control
Detects and resolves issues like lost packets or network congestion.

Network Layer Devices
Routers – Forward packets between different networks using IP addresses.
Layer 3 Switches – Perform routing within large networks.
Firewalls – Filter and secure network traffic at Layer 3.

Network Layer in Cybersecurity
IP Spoofing – Attackers disguise their IP to bypass security measures.
DDoS Attacks – Flooding a network with excessive traffic to cause downtime.
Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks – Intercepting network traffic to steal sensitive data.
Mitigation Measures – Firewalls, IDS/IPS, secure routing protocols, VPNs.

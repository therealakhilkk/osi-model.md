Application Layer (Layer 7) of the OSI Model
The Application Layer is the topmost layer (Layer 7) of the OSI model. It serves as the interface between the user and the network, 
enabling applications to communicate over a network. This layer directly interacts with end-user applications such as web browsers, 
email clients, and file transfer tools.

Functions 

Network Services Access – Provides access to network services like web browsing, email, and file sharing.

Data Formatting & Encoding – Ensures data is properly formatted and encoded for transmission.

Protocol Implementation – Uses various protocols like HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and DNS for communication.

User Authentication & Authorization – Verifies user access to network resources.

Error Handling & Logging – Manages errors, logs activities, and ensures smooth communication.

Application Layer in Cybersecurity

Vulnerabilities: Web attacks (SQL injection, XSS), phishing, and email spoofing.
Security Measures: HTTPS, secure authentication, firewalls, and encryption.

Here are some common types of attacks that target the Application layer

SQL Injection (SQLi),
Man-in-the-Middle (MitM),
Denial of Service (DoS),
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS),
Remote Code Execution (RCE).

The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a 
communication system into seven layers. Developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 
in 1984, the OSI model helps different network devices and protocols communicate effectively by following a 
structured approach.

Why OSI Model?
Ensures interoperability between different systems and networks.
Provides a modular approach, making it easier to troubleshoot and develop network technologies.
Defines clear responsibilities for each layer, improving network efficiency and security.

It is a 7 layer architecture with each layer having specific functionality to perform.
All these 7 layers work collaboratively to transmit the data from one person to another across the globel.

Seven Layers of OSI Model
Physical Layer – Deals with hardware, cables, and signals for data transmission.
Data Link Layer – Manages MAC addresses, error detection, and framing of data.
Network Layer – Handles IP addressing, routing, and packet forwarding.
Transport Layer – Ensures reliable data transfer using TCP/UDP.
Session Layer – Manages communication sessions between devices.
Presentation Layer – Handles encryption, compression, and data formatting.
Application Layer – Provides network services like HTTP, FTP, and email.

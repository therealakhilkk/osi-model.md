The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a 
communication system into seven layers. Developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 
in 1984, the OSI model helps different network devices and protocols communicate effectively by following a 
structured approach.

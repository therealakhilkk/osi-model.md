Physical Layer (Layer 1) of the OSI Model
The Physical Layer is the lowest layer (Layer 1) of the OSI model. It is responsible for the transmission of raw binary data (0s and 1s) over the physical medium, such as cables, radio waves, or optical fibers. 
This layer defines the electrical, mechanical, and procedural characteristics of the network’s physical connection.

Functions

Bit Transmission
Converts digital data (0s and 1s) into electrical, optical, or radio signals for transmission.
Example: Converting binary data into light pulses in fiber optic cables.

Transmission Medium Specification
Defines the type of media used for communication (wired or wireless).
Example: Copper cables (Ethernet), fiber optics, radio waves (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth).

Data Rate Control (Bandwidth)
Determines the speed at which data is transmitted (measured in bps - bits per second).
Example: Gigabit Ethernet (1 Gbps), 5G networks (10 Gbps+).

Signal Encoding & Modulation
Converts data into signals that can travel over a physical medium.
Example: Frequency Modulation (FM) in wireless communication.

Topology and Connection Types
Defines physical network layouts like bus, star, mesh, and ring.
Example: Ethernet networks commonly use a star topology with switches.

Synchronization
Ensures sender and receiver are synchronized to interpret the data correctly.
Example: Clock signals in synchronous communication.

Physical Layer in Cybersecurity
Wiretapping – Intercepting signals in cables to eavesdrop on data.
Jamming Attacks – Disrupting wireless communication using radio interference.
Cable Tampering – Physically cutting or tapping network cables to manipulate traffic.
Mitigation Measures – Using fiber optic cables (harder to tap), secure server rooms, electromagnetic shielding (TEMPEST), and encryption.
